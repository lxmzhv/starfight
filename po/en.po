#~ "\n"
#~ "The game is played by two players on opposing corners of the board. The "
#~ "goal of the game is to transfer all of one's pieces from one's own camp "
#~ "into the camp in the opposing corner. Each turn, a player either moves a "
#~ "single piece to an adjacent open square, or jumps over one or more his or "
#~ "opponent's pieces in sequence. A player who reached the camp in opposing "
#~ "corner faster wins."
